## System Overview

This project implements a sophisticated hybrid image recommendation system that combines collaborative filtering with content-based filtering using deep learning techniques. The system learns from both user-item interaction patterns and visual features extracted from images to provide personalized recommendations.

### Core Components

1. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates realistic user-item interactions and corresponding images
2. **Image Feature Extraction**: Uses pre-trained CNNs to extract visual features
3. **Collaborative Filtering**: Matrix factorization with bias terms
4. **Hybrid Architecture**: Learnable fusion of CF and content-based signals
5. **Training Pipeline**: End-to-end optimization with validation and model selection

### Key Innovation

The system employs a learnable weighted fusion mechanism that automatically balances collaborative filtering signals with content-based image features, allowing the model to adapt to different domains and datasets.

## Mathematical Foundations

### 1. Collaborative Filtering (Matrix Factorization)

#### Basic Matrix Factorization
Given a user-item rating matrix R ∈ ℝ^(m×n), we factorize it into:
```
R ≈ U · V^T
```
where:
- U ∈ ℝ^(m×k): User embedding matrix
- V ∈ ℝ^(n×k): Item embedding matrix
- k: Embedding dimension

#### Matrix Factorization with Bias
The prediction for user i and item j is:
```
r̂ᵢⱼ = μ + bᵢ + bⱼ + uᵢ · vⱼ
```
where:
- μ: Global bias (mean rating)
- bᵢ: User i bias
- bⱼ: Item j bias
- uᵢ: User i embedding vector
- vⱼ: Item j embedding vector

#### Loss Function
```
L_CF = Σ(i,j)∈Ω (rᵢⱼ - r̂ᵢⱼ)² + λ(||U||²_F + ||V||²_F + ||b_u||² + ||b_v||²)
```
where Ω is the set of observed ratings and λ is the regularization parameter.

### 2. Content-Based Filtering (Image Features)

#### Feature Extraction
Using pre-trained CNN (ResNet50):
```
f_visual = CNN_backbone(I_j)
f_content = MLP(f_visual)
```
where:
- I_j: Image for item j
- f_visual ∈ ℝ^2048: Raw CNN features
- f_content ∈ ℝ^512: Processed content features

#### Content-Based Prediction
```
r̂ᵢⱼ^content = MLP_content(f_content_j)
```

### 3. Hybrid Architecture

#### Feature Fusion
The collaborative and content features are combined using:
```
h_CF = MLP_CF([uᵢ; vⱼ])
h_content = MLP_content(f_content_j)
h_fused = [h_CF; h_content]
```

#### Final Prediction
```
r̂ᵢⱼ^hybrid = MLP_fusion(h_fused)
r̂ᵢⱼ^final = α · r̂ᵢⱼ^CF + (1-α) · r̂ᵢⱼ^hybrid
```
where α is a learnable parameter that balances CF and content signals.

#### Learnable Alpha
```
α = σ(w_α)
```
where σ is the sigmoid function and w_α is a learnable parameter.

### 4. Training Objective

#### Combined Loss
```
L = L_MSE + λ_reg · L_reg
L_MSE = Σ(i,j) (rᵢⱼ - r̂ᵢⱼ^final)²
L_reg = ||θ||²
```
where θ represents all model parameters.

#### Optimization
Uses AdamW optimizer with:
- Learning rate: 0.001
- Weight decay: 1e-5
- Gradient clipping: max_norm = 1.0

## Architecture Deep Dive

### 1. Data Generation Pipeline

#### User Preference Modeling
Users are characterized by preference vectors p_u ∈ ℝ^5 representing:
- Color preferences
- Style preferences  
- Texture preferences
- Complexity preferences
- Brand preferences

#### Item Characteristic Modeling
Items have characteristic vectors c_j ∈ ℝ^5 corresponding to user preferences.

#### Rating Generation
```
base_rating = 2 + 2 · (p_u · c_j) / ||p_u|| ||c_j||
final_rating = clip(base_rating + ε, 1, 5)
```
where ε ~ N(0, 0.5) is Gaussian noise.

#### Image Generation
Synthetic images are generated based on item characteristics:
```python
if c_j[0] > 0.5:  # Circular patterns
    add_circular_pattern(image, color=c_j[1:4])
if c_j[4] > 0.5:  # Rectangular patterns
    add_rectangular_pattern(image, color=c_j[2:5])
```

### 2. Image Feature Extraction

#### Pre-trained CNN Architecture
Using ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet:
```
Input: 224×224×3 image
↓
ResNet50 backbone (frozen weights)
↓
Global Average Pooling: 2048-d features
↓
MLP: 2048 → 512 → 512
↓
Output: 512-d image features
```

#### Feature Processing
```python
class ImageFeatureExtractor(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        # Frozen backbone
        with torch.no_grad():
            features = self.backbone(x)  # [B, 2048, 1, 1]
            features = features.view(B, -1)  # [B, 2048]
        
        # Trainable head
        features = self.feature_head(features)  # [B, 512]
        return features
```

```

**Content Branch:**
```
image_features → Linear(512, 256) → ReLU → Dropout(0.3) → Linear(256, 256)
```

**Fusion Network:**
```
[cf_features; content_features] → Linear(512, 256) → ReLU → Dropout(0.3) 
→ BatchNorm1d(256) → Linear(256, 128) → ReLU → Dropout(0.2) → Linear(128, 1)
```

### 4. Training Strategy

#### Multi-Component Training
The model is trained end-to-end with three prediction components:
1. CF prediction: Traditional matrix factorization
2. Hybrid prediction: Fusion of CF and content features
3. Final prediction: Learnable weighted combination

#### Learning Rate Scheduling

scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(
    optimizer, mode='min', factor=0.5, patience=5
)
```

#### Early Stopping
